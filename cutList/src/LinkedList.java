/*
 * Write the code for the stubbed out cutList method at the bottom of this class.
 * If the index is less than 0, set the index to 0.
 * If the index is greater than size, set the index to size.
 * 
 * The existing list should be cut at the specified index.  The location of the cut
 * should then be assigned to a new LinkedList and returned from the method.  All nodes
 * from the cut point on will be part of the new LinkedList.
 * 
 * The existing list will terminate at the point where the list was cut.
 * 
 * Note that cutting at an index of 0 will empty the existing list.
 * Cutting at an index the same as the size of the list will leave the
 * existing list unchanged and the new LinkedList will be empty.
